# Refactoring Challenge

This is an application for practicing refactoring code. The code functions, but is not easy to work with.
In this exercise you will add a feature to the code while improving code quality.

## Instructions

You will need to add the ability to generate a rate that should be applied in Australia during the Fall to this application.

For the purposed of this exercise, Fall in the southern hemisphere is defined as the months of March, April, and May.

Being a good developer, you will quickly notice that the calculateRate method is poorly written and needs to be refactored.

Bonus points for
Measuring how much you can reduce the complexity of the application. (i.e. use a metric to measure complexity)
Showing how you progressively improve the code by tagging after each major improvement you make.

## Getting Started

Running the application: `gradle build test run`

All output is written to the console.
